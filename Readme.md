I wrote this service some time ago and purpose of this service was to
create a Garage Management System. I updated this service with Spring boot 3.2.1 
and updated some spring security features.

Functionalities are as follows:
1) Types of vehicle can enter into the garage for example CAR and Motorbike.
2) Find vehicle location in a multi-storeyed Garage.
3) Roles based authentication for example USER and MANAGER.

How to use after git clone
1) Java 17 or higher and Docker must be installed in system
2) open cmd
3) cd Path to Project
4) command to start the project : docker-compose up -d
5) command to stop the project : docker-compose down 

Learning Outcome :
Java, Spring Web, Spring Security, Spring Data and Docker
